FRED is you, me, and other **FR**ont **E**nd **D**evelopers around the web. To be a FREDder, you just have to show up to a meetup or join in the discussion online. It's that easy!

The FRED organization itself was originally started by [Chris Van Patten](http://twitter.com/ChrisVanPatten) and [Dennis Gaebel](http://twitter.com/gryghostvisuals) in [Buffalo](/buffalo/). After a successful couple of months, they decided FRED was ready to see the world, and with the help of [Simon Owen](http://twitter.com/simonowendesign) from [Manchester](/manchester/), began building the FRED movement.
