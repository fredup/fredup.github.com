###&sect; WHAT IS FRED?
FRED stands for FRont End Developers, and is (as far as we can tell) the first multi-city meetup for front-end devs. FRED provides an outlet for front-end developers to talk and share about this exciting and crucial new craft.

###&sect; CAN I GET INVOLVED IN FRED?
Yes! Whether it's starting your own FRED, speaking at a FRED event, or just joining in the discussion online, we'd love to have your voice contribute to FRED.

FRED is not a bureacracy, and you don't need anyone's permission. Just start something and keep us updated. We'll help however we can. As a reminder we do not endorse recruiters and solicitors at any FRED event. At its core FRED is a learning platform to connect with the community about Front-end Web Development.

###&sect; WHO IS FRED?
FRED is you, me, and other FRont End Developers around the web. To become a FRED, you just have to attend a meet up or join in on the discussion online. It's that easy!

The FRED organization itself was originally started by [Chris Van Patten](https://github.com/chrisvanpatten) and [Dennis Gaebel](https://github.com/grayghostvisuals) in Buffalo, N.Y.. After a successful couple of months, they decided FRED was ready to see the world, and with the help of [Simon Owen](https://github.com/simonowendesign) from Manchester, U.K., began building the [FRED](http://fredup.github.com) movement.

###Adding Your City:

To add you city simply duplicate the “``sample``” directory within the root of this project and rename. Make sure to name it something cool that ends with “FRED” (all upper case). We've also provided the hexagon ``.psd`` logo within this directory for groups to customize and use for each individual chapter. Be creative as you'd like with this shape. Anything inside that is tasteful goes!
