**FRED** stands for **FR**ont **E**nd **D**evelopers, and is (as far as we can tell) the first multi-city meetup for front-end devs.

FRED provides an outlet for front-end developers to talk and share about this exciting and crucial new craft.

Current FREDs:

+ [Buffalo, NY](/buffalo/)
+ [Manchester, UK](/manchester/)
