		<h2>Who is FRED?</h2>

		<p>FRED is you, me, and other <strong>FR</strong>ont <strong>E</strong>nd <strong>D</strong>evelopers around the web. To be a FREDder, you just have to show up to a meetup or join in the discussion online. It's that easy!</p>

		<p>The FRED organization itself was originally started by <a href="http://twitter.com/ChrisVanPatten">Chris Van Patten</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/gryghostvisuals">Dennis Gaebel</a> in <a href="/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>. After a successful couple of months, they decided FRED was ready to see the world, and with the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/simonowendesign">Simon Owen</a> from <a href="/manchester/">Manchester</a>, began building the FRED movement.</p>
